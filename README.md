<h2>A Small weather api I created in python using the api from <a href="https://home.openweathermap.org/">openweather.org</a></h2>  

It outputs the high and low temperature from my city when run. 
To output your own city, just change the latitude, longitude and city name in the print function, as well as using your own free api key from openweather.org.
